This post contains my research notes about the parametric oscillator. Here is an introduction from Wikipedia (see references section):

> A parametric oscillator is a harmonic oscillator whose parameters oscillate in time. For example, a well known parametric oscillator is a child pumping a swing by periodically standing and squatting to increase the size of the swing's oscillations. The varying of the parameters drives the system. Examples of parameters that may be varied are its resonance frequency $\omega$ and damping $\beta$.
